**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Partial Success)
**Scope:** Relation Extraction model training and evaluation
**Previous:** P07 - RE Preparation
**Next:** M3 Phase 2 - RE Improvement

---

## Executive Summary

Completed Relation Extraction (RE) model training achieving **82.95% Micro F1 score** on test set, exceeding the primary target metric (≥0.75). However, the model shows **mixed performance** across relation types: excellent results for `found_at` relation (F1 0.8621) and `NO_RELATION` classification (F1 0.9032), but **complete failure** to learn rare relations (`assigned_to`, `part_of`) and suboptimal performance on `occurs_in` (F1 0.5528).

**Key Achievement:** Successfully demonstrated RE feasibility for high-frequency relations with auto-generated training data.

**Key Challenge:** Insufficient training data and pattern coverage for rare relations (<3% of dataset) prevents learning.

### Relation Performance Analysis

**Excellent Performance: found_at (F1 0.8621)**
- **Reason:**
  - Sufficient training data (738 train, 102 test)
  - Clear linguistic patterns: "TAXON from/at LOC"
  - High recall (0.9804): Only 2/102 samples missed
  - Good precision (0.7692): 77% of predictions correct
- **Conclusion:** Production-ready for deployment

**Good Performance: NO_RELATION (F1 0.9032)**
- **Reason:**
  - Dominant class (66.7% of data)
  - Negative sampling strategy effective
  - High precision (0.9577): Very few false positives
  - Good recall (0.8547): Catches most negative pairs
- **Conclusion:** Reliable negative filtering

**Poor Performance: occurs_in (F1 0.5528)**
- **Issues:**
  - Moderate training data (340 train, 44 test)
  - Pattern overlap with other relations
  - Low precision (0.4304): Many false positives (occurs_in predicted but wrong)
  - Good recall (0.7727): Finds most true positives
- **Conclusion:** Needs improvement before production use

**Complete Failure: assigned_to (F1 0.0000)**
- **Issues:**
  - Insufficient training data (91 train, 12 test = 2.5%)
  - Model never predicted this class (all 12 misclassified)
  - Misclassifications: NO_RELATION(5), occurs_in(6), found_at(1)
- **Root Cause:** Class weight (2.0) insufficient to overcome data scarcity
- **Conclusion:** Requires 5-10× more training data

**Complete Failure: part_of (F1 0.0000)**
- **Issues:**
  - Insufficient training data (52 train, 14 test = 1.4%)
  - Model never predicted this class (all 14 misclassified)
  - Misclassifications: All 14 → occurs_in (confused with similar patterns)
  - Pattern confusion: "Wheeler Member of Marjum Formation" → occurs_in vs part_of
- **Root Cause:** Smallest class + pattern similarity with occurs_in
- **Conclusion:** Requires better patterns and more training data

## Confusion Matrix

### Test Set Predictions

```
                    Predicted
                    NO   occ  fnd  asg  prt
True NO_RELATION:   294   24   26    0    0
     occurs_in:       7   34    3    0    0
     found_at:        1    1  100    0    0
     assigned_to:     5    6    1    0    0
     part_of:         0   14    0    0    0
```

### Key Error Patterns

**1. NO_RELATION Confusion (50 errors)**
- 24 → occurs_in: Entity pairs with co-occurrence but no semantic relation
- 26 → found_at: Proximity-based false positives

**2. occurs_in Confusion (10 errors)**
- 7 → NO_RELATION: Weak contextual signals
- 3 → found_at: TAXON-LOC pairs misidentified

**3. found_at Success (100/102 correct)**
- Only 2 errors: 1 → NO_RELATION, 1 → occurs_in
- Near-perfect classification for this relation

**4. assigned_to Complete Failure (12/12 wrong)**
- 5 → NO_RELATION: Model treats as negative
- 6 → occurs_in: Incorrect relation type
- 1 → found_at: Wrong relation type

**5. part_of Complete Failure (14/14 wrong)**
- 14 → occurs_in: Systematic misclassification
- Pattern overlap: "Member of Formation" confused with "occurs in Formation"

## Error Analysis

### Root Causes

**1. Severe Class Imbalance**

| Class | Train % | Test % | F1 Score | Success |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| NO_RELATION | 66.7% | 66.7% | 0.9032 | ✅ |
| found_at | 20.1% | 19.8% | 0.8621 | ✅ |
| occurs_in | 9.3% | 8.5% | 0.5528 | ⚠️ |
| assigned_to | 2.5% | 2.3% | 0.0000 | ❌ |
| part_of | 1.4% | 2.7% | 0.0000 | ❌ |

**Observation:** Classes <3% failed completely, classes >19% succeeded.

**Threshold:** ~10-15% minimum representation needed for learning with current approach.

**2. Pattern-Based Labeling Quality**

Expected accuracy: 50-70% (auto-generated from regex patterns)

**Quality Issues:**
- False positives: Pattern matches without semantic relation
- False negatives: Valid relations not captured by patterns
- Pattern overlap: Different relations with similar surface forms

**Impact on Rare Classes:**
- 50-70% of 91 assigned_to samples = 45-64 clean samples
- Insufficient for neural learning with noise

**3. Pattern Confusion: occurs_in vs part_of**

**Ambiguous Cases:**
```
"Wheeler Member of the Marjum Formation"
→ Pattern: "{STRAT1} Member of {STRAT2}"
→ Could be: occurs_in (taxa occur in Wheeler within Marjum)
→ Should be: part_of (Wheeler is subdivision of Marjum)

"trilobites in the Wheeler Formation"
→ Pattern: "in {STRAT}"
→ Should be: occurs_in (taxon-strat relation)
→ Not: part_of (strat-strat relation)
```

**Result:** Model learns dominant pattern (occurs_in) and misclassifies all part_of → occurs_in.

**4. Entity Type Ambiguity**

**assigned_to confusion:**
```
"Cambrian Stage 5"
→ Entity types: CHRONO + CHRONO (not STRAT → CHRONO)
→ Pattern fails on nested chronostratigraphic units
```

**Solution needed:** Better entity typing or relation-specific entity filtering.

## Success Factors

### 1. Entity Marker Approach
- Special tokens `[SUBJ]`, `[/SUBJ]`, `[OBJ]`, `[/OBJ]` clearly identify entity spans
- Simple and effective for classification task
- Works well with DeBERTa attention mechanism

### 2. DAPT Foundation
- Domain-adapted base model provides strong semantic understanding
- Rare-token recognition (Olenellus, Wheeler Formation) aids relation extraction
- Contextual embeddings capture paleontological domain knowledge

### 3. Class Weighting Strategy
- Downweighting NO_RELATION (0.5) prevents overwhelming positive relations
- Upweighting positive relations (2.0-2.5) helps with imbalance
- Effective for classes with sufficient samples (found_at, occurs_in)

### 4. Label Smoothing
- 0.1 smoothing factor helps handle pattern-based label noise
- Prevents overconfident predictions on noisy training data
- Allows generalization beyond surface patterns

### 5. found_at Relation Excellence
- Simplest relation with clear patterns
- Sufficient training data (738 samples)
- High-quality patterns with low ambiguity
- **Validation:** This relation is production-ready

---

## Failure Factors

### 1. Insufficient Rare Class Data
- **assigned_to:** 91 train samples (2.5%) → 0% learning
- **part_of:** 52 train samples (1.4%) → 0% learning
- **Minimum needed:** ~500-1000 samples per class (10-20× current)

### 2. Pattern Coverage Gaps
- 50-70% accuracy expected from pattern-based labeling
- For rare classes, this means 25-45 clean samples
- Insufficient for neural model to learn discriminative features

### 3. Class Weight Limitations
- Weights 2.0-2.5 insufficient to overcome 40:1 imbalance
- Would need weights >10 for rare classes, risking instability
- Better solution: Data augmentation, not just reweighting

### 4. Pattern Overlap (part_of ↔ occurs_in)
- Surface patterns too similar
- Model defaults to more frequent class (occurs_in)
- Need explicit disambiguation features

### 5. Auto-Annotation Quality
- No manual validation of generated samples
- False positives introduce noise
- False negatives reduce effective training data
- Most harmful for rare classes with few samples

---

## Comparison to Expectations

### Initial Predictions (P07 Preparation)

**Expected with auto-annotation (50-70% quality):**
- Pilot run Micro F1: 0.65-0.75
- found_at, occurs_in F1: 0.70-0.85
- assigned_to, part_of F1: 0.50-0.70 (with manual correction)

**Actual Results:**
- **Micro F1: 0.8295** (exceeded expectations!)
- **found_at F1: 0.8621** (excellent)
- **occurs_in F1: 0.5528** (below expectations)
- **assigned_to, part_of F1: 0.0000** (complete failure)

**Conclusion:** Auto-annotation works for frequent relations (>15% of data) but fails for rare relations (<3% of data). Manual annotation or better pattern engineering essential for rare classes.

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Data Volume Trumps Weighting**
   - Class weights help but cannot overcome 40:1 imbalance
   - Minimum viable class size: ~500 samples for 5-way classification
   - Current approach: 91 assigned_to, 52 part_of → insufficient

2. **Pattern Quality Matters More for Rare Classes**
   - 50-70% accuracy tolerable for frequent classes
   - 50-70% accuracy fatal for rare classes (<50 clean samples)
   - Need 80-90% accuracy patterns or manual validation for rare relations

3. **Entity Markers Work Well**
   - Simple, effective, easy to implement
   - Clear span identification helps model focus
   - No issues with marker token learning

4. **DAPT Base Essential**
   - Strong domain understanding visible in found_at performance
   - Contextual knowledge compensates for pattern limitations
   - Without DAPT, likely all classes would fail

5. **Macro F1 Not Suitable Metric**
   - Heavily penalized by rare class failure
   - Micro F1 better reflects practical utility
   - Should use weighted F1 or support-threshold filtering

### Process Insights

1. **Auto-Annotation Limitations**
   - Works for frequent, unambiguous relations (found_at)
   - Fails for rare, ambiguous relations (assigned_to, part_of)
   - Need hybrid approach: auto-annotation + manual validation

2. **Class Distribution Matters**
   - 2:1 negative:positive ratio achieved as planned
   - But positive class distribution highly skewed
   - Should have upsampled rare classes (SMOTE, paraphrasing)

3. **Early Warning Signs Visible**
   - Training data distribution predicted failure
   - assigned_to (2.5%), part_of (1.4%) → red flags
   - Should have augmented before training

4. **Pattern Overlap Needs Attention**
   - occurs_in vs part_of confusion should have been addressed
   - Need explicit disambiguation rules
   - Could use entity type constraints (TAXON-STRAT vs STRAT-STRAT)

---

## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 2A: Data Augmentation (Short-term)

**Goal:** Increase rare class samples to 500+ each

**Approaches:**
1. **Manual Annotation** (100-200 samples each)
   - Review auto-generated false negatives
   - Annotate high-confidence entity pairs
   - Focus on clear, unambiguous examples

2. **Pattern Engineering** (200-300 samples each)
   - Add more specific patterns for assigned_to, part_of
   - Refine existing patterns to reduce false positives
   - Use linguistic resources (dependency parsing)

3. **Paraphrasing** (100-200 samples each)
   - Back-translation (English → German → English)
   - Synonym substitution for verbs/prepositions
   - Template-based generation

4. **PDF Mining** (variable)
   - Extract more samples from additional trilobite papers
   - Target papers with stratigraphic sections (more assigned_to, part_of)

**Expected Impact:** assigned_to F1 0.60-0.70, part_of F1 0.55-0.65

### Phase 2B: Model Refinement (Medium-term)

**Goal:** Improve learning for imbalanced classes

**Approaches:**
1. **Focal Loss**
   - Replace cross-entropy with focal loss
   - Automatic hard example mining
   - Down-weight easy negatives

2. **Hierarchical Classification**
   - Stage 1: Positive vs NO_RELATION
   - Stage 2: Relation type (4-way)
   - Separate optimization for each stage

3. **Data Resampling**
   - Oversample rare classes during training
   - SMOTE-style synthetic examples
   - Maintain original distribution for validation

4. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Train separate binary classifiers per relation
   - Combine predictions with calibration
   - Better handling of class overlap

**Expected Impact:** occurs_in F1 0.70-0.75, assigned_to F1 0.70-0.75, part_of F1 0.65-0.70

### Phase 2C: Pattern Disambiguation (Medium-term)

**Goal:** Resolve occurs_in ↔ part_of confusion

**Approaches:**
1. **Entity Type Constraints**
   - occurs_in: TAXON → STRAT only
   - part_of: STRAT → STRAT only
   - Filter candidates by entity type pairs

2. **Contextual Features**
   - Linguistic cues: "Member", "Formation", "within", "of"
   - Dependency paths between entities
   - Sentence-level features

3. **Post-processing Rules**
   - If both entities are STRAT → cannot be occurs_in
   - If "Member of" pattern → part_of, not occurs_in
   - Domain knowledge constraints

**Expected Impact:** part_of F1 0.60-0.70, occurs_in F1 0.70-0.80

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (Long-term)

**Goal:** End-to-end pipeline integration

**Requirements Before Deployment:**
- All relation F1 ≥ 0.70
- Macro F1 ≥ 0.70
- Manual validation on 100-sample gold standard

**Deployment Strategy:**
1. Deploy found_at extraction (production-ready now)
2. Deploy occurs_in with confidence threshold >0.80
3. Hold assigned_to, part_of until Phase 2 improvements
4. Implement human-in-the-loop review for low-confidence predictions

---

## Conclusion

**M3 Phase 1 completed with partial success**: RE model training demonstrated feasibility of entity marker approach and achieved excellent performance for high-frequency relations (`found_at` F1 0.86, `NO_RELATION` F1 0.90), meeting the primary Micro F1 target (0.83 > 0.75). However, **severe class imbalance** (assigned_to 2.5%, part_of 1.4%) combined with pattern-based auto-annotation quality issues resulted in **complete failure** to learn rare relations.

**Key Validation:** found_at relation extraction is **production-ready**, proving the overall architecture (DAPT → NER → RE with entity markers) is sound.

**Critical Gap:** Rare relation extraction requires 5-10× more training data (500+ samples per class) and higher-quality annotations (80-90% accuracy vs current 50-70%). Phase 2A data augmentation is **essential** before M3 can be considered complete.

**Strategic Decision:** Deploy found_at extraction immediately while pursuing parallel data augmentation efforts for rare relations. This provides immediate value while building toward full relation extraction capability.
