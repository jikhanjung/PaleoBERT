**Strong Performance: TAXON (99.56%), STRAT (99.53%)**
- Reason: Domain-specific tokens in vocabulary
- Clear morphological patterns (binomial nomenclature, Formation/Member)

**Good Performance: LOC (96.12%)**
- Reason: Geographic names more ambiguous
- Overlap with modern/ancient place names
- Still exceeds target by 16.1%

## Error Analysis

### Error Distribution Estimate

Based on test F1 scores, error rates:
- **TAXON errors:** ~0.44% (99.56% correct)
- **STRAT errors:** ~0.47% (99.53% correct)
- **CHRONO errors:** ~0.25% (99.75% correct)
- **LOC errors:** ~3.88% (96.12% correct)

### Likely Error Patterns

**1. LOC Ambiguity (~3.88% error rate)**
- Modern vs. paleontological localities
- Generic place names (e.g., "Western Utah" vs. "Utah")
- Overlapping with STRAT (e.g., "House Range" as locality or formation)

**2. Nested Entities**
- "Middle Wheeler Formation" - Middle as CHRONO or part of name?
- "Lower Cambrian strata" - "Lower Cambrian" as CHRONO or adjective?

**3. Abbreviations**
- "Fm." for Formation
- "Mbr." for Member
- Stage numbers without context

### Mitigation Strategies

For production use:
1. **Manual review** of LOC predictions (3.88% error)
2. **Contextual disambiguation** rules for ambiguous cases
3. **Post-processing** for nested entity resolution
4. **Gold-standard test set** for final validation

- Prevented overfitting to noisy auto-generated labels
- Enabled generalization beyond surface patterns

### 4. Auto-Annotation Strategy

- 60-70% expected accuracy sufficient for neural learning
- Cost-effective vs. manual annotation (~8 min for 73K sentences)

### 5. Training Configuration
- Appropriate learning rate (2e-5 for fine-tuning)
- Effective batch size (32) for stable gradients
- Early stopping prevented overfitting
