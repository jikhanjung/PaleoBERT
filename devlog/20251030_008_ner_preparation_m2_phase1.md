# M2 Phase 1: NER Preparation - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Scope:** NER annotation schema design, auto-annotation, and training setup
**Next:** M2 Phase 2 - NER model training (in progress)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed all preparation work for Named Entity Recognition (NER) training as part of Milestone M2. Designed comprehensive annotation schema for 4 entity types (TAXON, STRAT, CHRONO, LOC), auto-generated 73,492 annotated sentences from the 1.57M token corpus, and implemented training infrastructure. NER model training has been initiated using the domain-adapted DAPT model as the base.

**Key Achievement:** From DAPT completion to NER training launch in ~3 hours, demonstrating efficient pipeline progression from domain adaptation to task-specific fine-tuning.

---

## Context: Transition from DAPT to NER

### DAPT Completion (P06 Phase 3)
- ✅ Domain-adapted model trained on 1.57M tokens
- ✅ Final eval loss: 7.54 (49.6% improvement)
- ✅ Rare-token perplexity: 2,116 (99.93% improvement)
- ✅ 0% fragmentation rate maintained
- ✅ Model checkpoint: `checkpoints/paleo-dapt-expanded/`

### Strategic Decision: Proceed to NER
**Question:** Continue DAPT with larger corpus OR proceed to NER?

**Decision:** **Proceed to NER (Option 2)**

**Rationale:**
1. DAPT successfully achieved domain adaptation goals
2. Rare-token perplexity reduction (99.93%) validates domain learning
3. NER is simpler than MLM - doesn't require perfect contextual understanding
4. Can validate end-to-end pipeline sooner
5. Task-specific fine-tuning will compensate for remaining DAPT limitations

## Phase 1: NER Annotation Schema Design

### Entity Types Defined

**1. TAXON (Taxonomic Names)**
- Scientific names at any rank: genus, species, family, order, class
- Examples: `Olenellus`, `Paradoxides davidis`, `Olenellidae`, `Trilobita`
- Includes informal groups: `olenellids`, `paradoxidids`
- Coverage: ~419 taxa in vocabulary

**2. STRAT (Stratigraphic Units)**
- Formal/informal stratigraphic units
- Examples: `Wheeler Formation`, `Burgess Shale`, `Middle Member`
- Includes lithologic descriptions with unit names
- Coverage: ~140 units in vocabulary

**3. CHRONO (Chronostratigraphic Units)**
- Time-stratigraphic and geochronologic terms
- Examples: `Cambrian Stage 10`, `Jiangshanian`, `Series 2`, `Early Cambrian`
- Includes both formal stages and informal time divisions
- Coverage: ~34 units in vocabulary

**4. LOC (Geographic Localities)**
- Geographic locations where fossils are found
- Examples: `House Range`, `western Utah`, `Morocco`, `Laurentia`
- Includes modern and paleogeographic locations
- Coverage: ~129 localities in vocabulary

### BIO Tagging Scheme

**Format:** Beginning-Inside-Outside
- `B-TYPE`: Beginning of entity
- `I-TYPE`: Inside/continuation of entity
- `O`: Outside any entity

**Total Labels:** 9
- `O` (non-entity)
- `B-TAXON`, `I-TAXON`
- `B-STRAT`, `I-STRAT`
- `B-CHRONO`, `I-CHRONO`
- `B-LOC`, `I-LOC`

### Annotation Guidelines

**Multi-word Entities:**
```
Text:  Olenellus gilberti from Wheeler Formation
Tags:  B-TAXON I-TAXON O B-STRAT I-STRAT
```

**Adjacent Entities:**
```
Text:  Cambrian Stage 10 trilobites
Tags:  B-CHRONO I-CHRONO I-CHRONO B-TAXON
```

**Ambiguity Resolution Rules:**
1. Formation names vs. Localities: Context-dependent
   - "Wheeler Formation" → STRAT (rock unit)
   - "Wheeler Amphitheater" → LOC (place)

2. Time vs. Strat: Formal vs. descriptive
   - "Cambrian Series 2" → CHRONO (formal)
   - "Lower Cambrian strata" → O (descriptive)

3. Taxonomic specificity:
   - "Olenellus" → TAXON (always)
   - "trilobites" → TAXON (refers to Class)
   - "the trilobite" → O (generic reference)

### Documentation Deliverable

**File:** `docs/ner_annotation_schema.md`
- 4 entity type definitions with examples
- BIO tagging scheme specification
- Annotation guidelines and edge cases
- Quality metrics and workflow
- Example annotated sentences

**Completeness:** Production-ready schema suitable for:
- Auto-annotation (current use)
- Manual annotation (future refinement)
- Inter-annotator agreement evaluation
- Training/evaluation

---

## Phase 2: Auto-Annotation from Corpus

### Approach: Vocabulary-Based Auto-Tagging

**Strategy:**
1. Use existing vocabulary lists (taxa.txt, strat_units.txt, chrono_units.txt, localities.txt)
2. Apply pattern matching for common formations (e.g., "X Formation", "Stage Y")
3. Prioritize entity types: TAXON > STRAT > CHRONO > LOC
4. Generate initial BIO tags automatically
5. Accept 60-70% expected accuracy for pilot training

**Implementation:** `scripts/generate_ner_samples.py`

### Corpus Processing

**Input:**
- Source: `data/corpus_norm/train_all_pdfs.jsonl`
- Total: 3,537 paragraphs, 1.57M tokens from 112 PDFs

**Sentence Splitting:**
- Split paragraphs into sentences using regex
- Filter: Sentences 20-500 characters
- Result: 73,492 sentences extracted

**Auto-Annotation Process:**
- Tokenize each sentence (whitespace + punctuation)
- Match multi-word entities from vocabularies (1-5 token spans)
- Apply pattern-based matching for formations/stages
- Assign BIO tags to matched tokens
- Processing time: ~8 minutes

### Generated Dataset Statistics

**Total Sentences:** 73,492

**Entity Distribution:**
| Entity Type | Count | Percentage | Avg per Sentence |
|-------------|-------|------------|------------------|
| TAXON       | 44,548| 76.3%      | 0.61             |
| LOC         | 6,279 | 10.8%      | 0.09             |
| CHRONO      | 4,438 | 7.6%       | 0.06             |
| STRAT       | 3,403 | 5.8%       | 0.05             |
| **Total**   | **58,668** | **100%** | **0.80** |

**Sentence Coverage:**
- Sentences with entities: 24,041 (32.7%)
- Sentences without entities: 49,451 (67.3%)
- Average entities per annotated sentence: 2.4

**Data Splits:**
| Split | Sentences | Percentage | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Train | 58,793    | 80%        | Model training |
| Dev   | 7,349     | 10%        | Hyperparameter tuning |
| Test  | 7,350     | 10%        | Final evaluation |

**Output Files:**
- `artifacts/ner_data/train.jsonl` - Training set
- `artifacts/ner_data/dev.jsonl` - Development set
- `artifacts/ner_data/test.jsonl` - Test set

**Format:** JSONL with structure:
```json
{
  "text": "Original sentence text",
  "tokens": ["token1", "token2", ...],
  "ner_tags": ["B-TAXON", "I-TAXON", "O", ...],
  "metadata": {
    "doc_id": "publication_id",
    "para_id": 123
  }
}
```

### Quality Assessment

**Expected Accuracy:** 60-70% (auto-annotation)

**Known Limitations:**
1. **Vocabulary coverage gaps:**
   - "Wheeler_Shale" fragmented (not in vocab)
   - Morphological terms (glabella, cephalon, pygidium) not in vocab
   - Some formations missing from strat_units.txt

2. **Pattern matching errors:**
   - "additional" incorrectly tagged as TAXON
   - Generic terms sometimes over-tagged
   - Compound names may be partially tagged

3. **Context insensitivity:**
   - Cannot distinguish formal vs. informal usage
   - May miss entities not in vocabulary
   - No disambiguation of homonyms

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Accept imperfect annotations for pilot NER training
- Neural model will learn from patterns despite noise
- Plan manual review/correction for production (future work)
- Use label smoothing (0.1) during training to handle noise

## Phase 3: NER Training Infrastructure

### Training Script Implementation

**File:** `scripts/train_ner.py`

**Key Features:**
1. **Data Loading:** JSONL → HuggingFace Dataset conversion
2. **Tokenization:** Subword alignment with BIO label propagation
3. **Model:** DeBERTa-v3-base → TokenClassification head
4. **Metrics:** seqeval-based F1, precision, recall (entity-level)
5. **Callbacks:** Early stopping, best model selection
6. **Logging:** TensorBoard integration

**Label Alignment Strategy:**
```
Word:     Olenellus  gilberti
Subwords: Olen ##ellus gil ##berti
Labels:   B-TAXON -100 I-TAXON -100
```
- First subword gets entity label
- Subsequent subwords get -100 (ignored in loss)
- Prevents double-counting multi-subword tokens

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Auto-Annotation Quality

**Issue 1: Vocabulary coverage gaps**
- Some formations not in vocabulary → not tagged
- Morphological terms missing → false negatives
- **Impact:** Reduces recall for STRAT entities
- **Mitigation:** Model may learn from context patterns

**Issue 2: Over-tagging generic terms**
- "additional" tagged as TAXON (incorrect)
- Context-free matching causes false positives
- **Impact:** Adds noise to training data
- **Mitigation:** Label smoothing (0.1) during training

**Issue 3: Multi-word fragmentation**
- "Wheeler_Shale" → split across tokens
- Inconsistent handling of underscored units
- **Impact:** Partial entity tagging
- **Mitigation:** Model tokenizer handles underscores

### Training Data Characteristics

**Issue 4: Entity imbalance**
- TAXON: 76.3% of entities
- STRAT: 5.8% of entities
